## Purpose
This site was built as a personal portfolio page. My web dev work is no longer particularly relevant and my work over the last few years is under tight NDA, so the page has been thinned out. 

## About the Author
### Robert D Allen, MBA
A born tinkerer, roboticist, and frustratingly optimistic creator. Before college I built a quad-copter, a year before drones were invented. In college I designed a triangular ROV (Remotely operated vehicle, submersible) for competition. When working as a recruiter I created an algorithm for establishing objective career progress. At Amazon, the machine learning marketing platform fell to me, so I designed a multivariate marketing schema which enabled dozens of assets to generate thousands of permutations for rapid global testing and iteration. 

Always chase the dopamine.
