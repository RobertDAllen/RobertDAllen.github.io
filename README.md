## About the Author
### Robert D Allen, MBA
I am a tinkerer. Having collected four degrees, spending some years launching businesses for clients, tooling around with robotics, and building a quad-copter before drones were invented, my path has led me back to a keyboard.

When I learned HTML my computer did not have a modem. Thankfully, back then Help docs were usually HTML documents installed locally so I had a pretty serious cache to draw from. This was before CSS existed. 

Over the years my casual interest languished as I got caught up in mechanical and electrical engineering. Robotics was a real passion for a while, but when the economy crashed just before my degree wrapped up my focus shifted to the market with the lowest barrier to entry for income - web design. 

After finishing my BS my income was largely dependent upon helping college friends build websites and launch businesses. Eventually grad school proved too appealing to resist, so I joined Rochester Institute of Technology in their award winning Entrepreneurship program for my MBA, collecting a total of three concentrations by the time I was done, including Entrepreneurship, Product Commercialization (marketing), and Technology Management.

Since then my work has been largely design and development focused, with startup strategy & marketing gigs along the way.
