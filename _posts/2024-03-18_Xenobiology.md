# Intracellular robustness and the effect on multicellular stability

I've had an idea for a while about xenobiology and the Drake Equation, and the end of this video is consistent with my notion. As life is inclined to variegate, morphological complexity will increase. Multicellular life introduces new intra-environmental forces such as predation and niche specialization. Draughts and radiation and temperature swings would be selecting on macro scale adaptations like mud baths, not cell-level capabilities like gene-repair proteins. The sophistication of microbes at the inflection point of multicellularity fixes the internal capabilities. If complex life arose on Earth 1bn years earlier, their cellular robustness (for temperatures, radiation, genetic ablation or recovery, membrane durability) would likely be less than ours. Likewise, if multicellularity were to arise on Earth for the first time today, the eventual sapiens would be beneficiaries of an extra few billion years of natural selection. Coming back to Drake, my notion is complex life arising from simpler prokaryotes would be more 'frail' at a cellular level, and succumb to extinction more easily. Thoughts?
